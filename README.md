This is an Android application that I made for my engineers thesis. The application is made in Java and XML. 
Functionalities of the application:
1. Showing a calendar view for the whole month, for a week and for a day.
2. Possibility of adding, editing and removing a medication from the SQL database that was created for the purpose of the application.
3. Giving alerts for the user about the necessity of taking a medication on time.

On the main screen, user is able to see the calendar view for the whole month, jump to previous and next months, jump into the specific day view by clicking on a day and move into a week view.
On the week view, user can see the list of the medication scheduled for the currently viewed week, see previous and next weeks and jump into a day view in two ways. There is a possibility to add a medication to the database.
On the day view, user can see every hour of the day with every medication scheduled for a specific hour, edit or remove the medication by clicking on it and add the new medication.
The application authomatically sets the alarm for the chosen date and hour and sends a notification about the necessity of taking the medication on time.
